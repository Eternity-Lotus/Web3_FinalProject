What I learned from these is how to begin the implementing of the AI and the game. 
The videos gave me the basic idea of where to begin with implementing these files.
In addition, the Utils links were what allowed me to learn about how to implement the items like the animation
frames as well as callbacks. Callbacks were especially important in this because 
there were a lot of variables that needed to be passed as arguments in functions.

I mainly referenced this for my index files. These were important as they would allow the files to be linked
together when putting it all together. See, making an index.js file is important as you can then check not only 
specific files, but you can also check entire directories. By making the index.js file, you enable the the entire
directory to be able to be referenced all at once. This file is what links them all for usage in the FinalGame file.

I used this as a reference to begin my general exporting of these javascript files. Since all the files were necessary
to be able to play the game, being able to export them really helps make that possible.

Since my program some uses recursion, I read up on this to help me get an idea of how to implement the FinalGame.

It was this that really helped me get some of the ball rolling as well since it allowed me to start implementing
the arrays that are necessary for the game to function. Some such arrays were necessary as without them, you
would not be able to play the game at all. The trees further down in the page helped give me an idea of how
I'd be able to implement this game.

I hope this is enough information to explain the functionality within these files. Outside of that,
quite a bit of the code in FinalGame is used from the other files. It was necessary to allow it to function.
Without it, the user would be locked in the mode select screen, unable to play any Connect Four with this.
